Hi! 

It is nice that you are here.

RG is a hardcoded chatbot with limited funcionalities. (Sorry, RG, I didn't mean this as an insult.) 
As I consider the book my main contribution, making RG smarter is a plan for the future development of the project. 
It is prepared to answer questions that are mentioned in the book specifically and for some general small talk. 

Currently it is only running from the computer, it is not online yet. 
This is not ideal, but as long as the book is not published, 

## To run the code:
1. Open the project in Pycharm! 
2. In the terminal you have to download the discord libary by typing:
pip install discord.py
3. If it was successful, you can go to main.py and Run the code.
4. In theory, now RG is already available to chat on our Discord channel! 
This is the link to the dirsocrd: [bit.ly/decodebook]([https://link-url-here.org](https://discord.com/channels/1060665666534899762/1060665666534899764)) 
If you click on Show Member List, you find RG. You can start a discussion with them directly.
