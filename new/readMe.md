# Hi! 

It is nice that you are here.

RG is a hardcoded chatbot with limited funcionalities. (Sorry, RG, I didn't mean this as an insult.) 
As I consider the book my main contribution, making RG smarter is a plan for the future development of the project. 
It is prepared to answer questions that are mentioned in the book specifically and for some general small talk. 

## To run the code:

### Environment: 
I have a Windows laptop, PyCharm 2022.3.2, Python interpreter 3.7. 

1. Open the project in Pycharm! 
2. In the terminal you have to download the discord libary by typing:
pip install discord.py
3. If it was successful, you can go to main.py and Run the code. On the Terminal you can follow if RG is running already.
4. In theory, now RG is already available to chat on our Discord channel! 
This is the link to the Discord channel: [bit.ly/decodebook](https://discord.com/channels/1060665666534899762/1060665666534899764) 
If you click on Show Member List, you find RG. You can start a discussion with them directly. 

(Worst case scenario: if you write me an email, I can run it from my computer, and you can just talk to RG on Discord.)


### Future:
Currently RG is only running from the computer, it is not on an online server yet. This is not ideal, but I hope it is fine for now. 
While I have been writing my thesis, ChatGPT became widely popular, which puts any regular chatbot in a less spectacular light. 
When developing the project further, considering an AI based chatbot trained on p5 documentation and Daniel Shiffman could be an option.
